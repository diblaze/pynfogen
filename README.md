# pynfogen

Scriptable MediaInfo-fed NFO Generator for Movies and TV.

## Installation

### Requirements

1. [pip], v19.0 or newer
2. [poetry], latest recommended

### Steps

1. `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` (optional)
2. `poetry install`
3. You now have a `.venv` folder in your project root directory. Python and dependencies are installed here.
4. To use the venv, follow [Poetry Docs: Using your virtual environment]

Note: Step 1 is recommended as it creates the virtual environment in one unified location per-project instead of
hidden away somewhere in Poetry's Cache directory.
